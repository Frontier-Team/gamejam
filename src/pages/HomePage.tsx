            Thank you for joining us for Game Jam Dundee! The Scottish Widows

          <Paragraph>
            Think of Reboot (who are supporting the event) but with a focus on
            games and gamification. It's a super fun event where we come
            together to brainstorm, design, and develop a game or gamified app
            from scratch - all within a limited time frame.
          </Paragraph>

            Whether you're a coding wizard, design guru, or just someone with a
            wild imagination and an interest in games, there's a place for you
            in this adventure. 60 attendees will word to solve challenges using
            games or gamification techniques over a 2-day period at the V&A
            museum in Dundee.

            This is a fantastic way to unleash creativity and explore new
            possibilities in game design by bringing together developers,
            designers, and other creatives to rapidly prototype and experiment
            with new ideas, mechanics, and art styles.
